### Reflection
--------------
I now have a thorough understanding of the complex procedures required to assemble and disassemble a computer thanks to the PC assembly class. Apart from the applied abilities acquired, I explored the nuances of every part, learning about its capabilities and how it functions as a whole. In addition to giving me the technical know-how to assemble and disassemble a PC, this practical experience expanded my understanding of the functions and relationships between different parts, which helped me get a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture.
