### Reflection
--------------
The industrial discussion emphasised how important it is to approach problem-solving by carefully integrating modern technology. It underlined how important it is to not only solve problems but also do so in a way that makes the most of technological improvements to improve and streamline solutions. This combined emphasis on creativity and careful application emphasises the importance of being aware of possible outcomes. Crucially, the discussion stressed that a workable solution needs to put people's and the environment's welfare first in addition to being economical and productive. This all-encompassing strategy makes sure that technical innovations minimise any potential negative effects while ensuring that they positively contribute to society progression.
