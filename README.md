| 1 | Assignment 1 (Poster) | In this fast-paced age of technological innovation, being proactive is essential to managing the future's complexities. It is not possible to succeed by waiting until the last minute; rather, success comes from timely and careful planning. It is imperative to keep ahead of the curve since technology is advancing at a rate that has never been seen before. Taking a proactive stance entails anticipating future advancements in addition to being current with technology trends. Individuals and organisations can deliberately position themselves in this way to take advantage of new opportunities and successfully handle obstacles. In a dynamic and always changing technology landscape, proactive preparedness is essential for success as it guarantees the capacity to adapt, innovate, and flourish in the face of uncertainty. |
| 2 | Assignment 2 (Video) |  The industrial visit to UTM Digital was incredibly insightful. One of the most impactful things I learned was how machine learning technologies are integrated into their processes. Seeing real-world applications and understanding the role these technologies play in optimising operations and decision-making was eye-opening. Additionally, the emphasis on cybersecurity measures and data privacy within the digital department highlighted the critical importance of safeguarding sensitive information in today's digital landscape. Overall, the experience provided a deep understanding of the cutting-edge technologies shaping the industry and the practical challenges that digital departments face on a day-to-day basis.

| 3 | Assignment 3 (Report) |My objective is to become a skilled system developer with a strong understanding of the broad trends in the constantly changing tech industry over the course of the next four years. I really think that it's important to be up to date in this subject. Because of my dedication to lifelong learning, I am able to keep up with industry developments and can easily incorporate new technologies and development techniques into my system development processes. I want to make my systems more flexible and long-lasting by keeping an eye on current trends and encouraging a culture of innovation and continuous development. |
| 4 | Assignment 4 (Newsletter) | The industrial discussion emphasised how important it is to approach problem-solving by carefully integrating modern technology. It underlined how important it is to not only solve problems but also do so in a way that makes the most of technological improvements to improve and streamline solutions. This combined emphasis on creativity and careful application emphasises the importance of being aware of possible outcomes. Crucially, the discussion stressed that a workable solution needs to put people's and the environment's welfare first in addition to being economical and productive. This all-encompassing strategy makes sure that technical innovations minimise any potential negative effects while ensuring that they positively contribute to society progression. |
| 5 | PC Assemble (Lab) | I now have a thorough understanding of the complex procedures required to assemble and disassemble a computer thanks to the PC assembly class. Apart from the applied abilities acquired, I explored the nuances of every part, learning about its capabilities and how it functions as a whole. In addition to giving me the technical know-how to assemble and disassemble a PC, this practical experience expanded my understanding of the functions and relationships between different parts, which helped me get a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture. |
| 6 | Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype) | My objective in studying computer science and software engineering is to achieve academic success and develop into a cutting-edge, marketable professional in the coming years. My completion of a design thinking project has demonstrated to me the importance of this approach to character development and efficient problem solving. In order to maximise my industry potential, I intend to aggressively pursue advanced knowledge on my own, going above and beyond what my peers have to offer, and get real-world experience by taking part in industrial trips.Â |
