| 5 | PC Assemble (Lab) | I now have a thorough understanding of the complex procedures required to assemble and disassemble a computer thanks to the PC assembly class. Apart from the applied abilities acquired, I explored the nuances of every part, learning about its capabilities and how it functions as a whole. In addition to giving me the technical know-how to assemble and disassemble a PC, this practical experience expanded my understanding of the functions and relationships between different parts, which helped me get a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture. |
| 6 | Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype) | My objective in studying computer science and software engineering is to achieve academic success and develop into a cutting-edge, marketable professional in the coming years. My completion of a design thinking project has demonstrated to me the importance of this approach to character development and efficient problem solving. In order to maximise my industry potential, I intend to aggressively pursue advanced knowledge on my own, going above and beyond what my peers have to offer, and get real-world experience by taking part in industrial trips.Â |
