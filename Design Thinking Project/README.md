### Reflection
-------------
What is your goal/dream with regard to your course/program?
- I set a goal to excel in academics and also be relevant in future industries regarding my course by increasing my knowledge throughout these 4 years. Specifically speaking, the computer science course, which is my course, needs someone who is really innovative and can develop something new from the existing product. As a student majoring in software engineering, I need to meet all of those criteria.

How does this design thinking impact on your goal/dream with regard to your program?
- From my experience in completing this design thinking project, I learned that the core principle of this project is really helpful in solving a problem in the best possible way, and it can also develop many values that can build a better character as a computer science student.

What is the action/improvement/plan necessary for you to improve your potential in the industry?
- In order to improve myself in this industry, I need to seek more knowledge on my own so that I can get more advanced compared to other students or freshmen in the same course. Other than that, I need to obtain experience by joining an industrial visit.
